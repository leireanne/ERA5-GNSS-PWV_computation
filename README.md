# Welcome!
These are some Matlab scripts to interpolate ERA5 pressure level data to the position of a GNSS station, and combine ERA5 mean temperature and pressure time series with GNSS-ZTD to derive GNSS-PWV.

> [!CAUTION]
> These scripts are not fully mature. Namely, the scripts were designed to operate in a very particular region (South of Spain), and no handling of exceptions has been implemented. A proper documentation is also missing. Changes are to come but, in the meanwhile, please use with caution.
